# ImageUtilities
Image and encoding utilities

This project has some swift/obj-c utilities to deal with images in iOS apps.
Mostly it is used at the mo to encode a data grainy layer on top of an image, like a qr code, that can store some 3 or 4 kB data, but is resiliant enough for the image to be shared online.
Let me know if you want more info.

It is used in the Synesthete app to encode the shader code on an image, while preserving the image somewhat.
